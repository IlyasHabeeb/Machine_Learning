Summary:

Programming Task - To train a classification algorithm to discriminate between sonar signals bounced off a metal cylinder and those bounced off a roughly cylindrical rock.

Machine Learning Algorithms Implemented:

Implemented Logistic Regression from scratch (without using scikit-learn)
Implemented Gradient Descent to optimize our Logistic Regression model from scratch (without using scikit-learn)
Implemented Regularized Logistic Regression to prevent our model from overfitting from scratch (without using scikit-learn)
